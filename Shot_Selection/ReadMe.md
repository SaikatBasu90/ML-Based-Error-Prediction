SHOT SELECTION


In IBMQ you can choose between 1 to 8192 number of shots to run your circuit. Optimization between Shot and Error and choosing a shot is no trivial.
It selects a best suitaed Shot for circuits with IBMQ_16_melbourne data on benchmark circuits.
On the basis of that shot the data set will be ceated for ultimate prediction algorithm.
