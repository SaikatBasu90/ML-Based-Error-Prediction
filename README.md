# Machine Learning Based Error Mitigation 


This tool considers a handfull of quantum circuit execution data from any specific quantum hardware. Here the data of IBMQ_16_melbourne is considered.
The idea is to minimize the number of fragmentation of a large quantum circuit with respect to the error predicted. This tool also be used for Error Influenced Binary Fragmentation Algorithm, thus providing a Classical on a hybrid quantum-classical computing system.
